# Subfolder `resources`
## Overview

This subfolder includes miscellaneous resources for setting up the environment and running the Mule application. More specifically, the resources include:

- `Contact_Data_100.csv` and `Contact_Data_1m.csv.zip`: sample contact data - i.e., 100 records and 1 million records zipped, respectively.

  I use the smaller file for unit and smoke testing, and the larger for demoing the execution of the Mule application. I modeled this data based on the `Contact` object in one of my Salesforce demo instances. However, I created the dataset using [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com).

- `Postgres-Contacts-Table.sql`: SQL scripts for creating the contacts table in the PostgreSQL database. 

  As a reminder, the Mule application reads contact data from a CSV file and inserts it into this table. Similarly, I modeled this table based on the `Contact` object in one of my Salesforce demo instances. I included the autogenerated `id` column for convenience as it enables me to rerun the Mule application without truncating or emptying the table every time.
